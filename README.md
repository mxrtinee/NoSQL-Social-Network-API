# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

## Description

This project is a social network API that utilizes a NoSQL database. It provides functionality for users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage friend lists. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose as the ODM. It's designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data typical in social network applications.
